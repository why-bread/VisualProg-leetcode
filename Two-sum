# LeetCode Problem: Two Sum
# Time Complexity: O(n)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        seen = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in seen:
                return [seen[diff], i]
            seen[num] = i

# Example usage (optional)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target = 9
    print(Solution().twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
